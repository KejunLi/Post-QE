# qe_post_processing

https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/

## Description:
This GitHub repository contains Python scripts for postprocessing data obtained from first-principles calculations using Quantum ESPRESSO (QE). The scripts are designed to analyze and visualize the results, providing insights into electronic structures, band structures, and other relevant properties.

## Features:
- Data Analysis:
```
Extract key information from Quantum ESPRESSO input and output files. 
Analyze electronic structures, total energy, atomic structure etc.
```

- Visualization:
```
Generate plots and visualizations for band structures from colinear or noncolinear calculations.
```

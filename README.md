# qe_post_processing

https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/

## Description:
This GitHub repository contains Python scripts for postprocessing data obtained from first-principles calculations using Quantum ESPRESSO (QE). The scripts are designed to analyze and visualize the results, providing insights into electronic structures, band structures, and other relevant properties.

## Features:
- Data Analysis:
```
Extract key information from Quantum ESPRESSO input and output files. 
Analyze electronic structures, total energy, atomic structure etc.
```
- Visualization:
Generate plots and visualizations for band structures, density of states (DOS), and crystal structures.
Provide tools for creating publication-quality figures.
Workflow Integration:

- Documentation:
```
Thorough documentation to guide users through the code and its functionalities.
Include examples and tutorials to help users get started quickly.
```

Modularity:

Organize code into modular components for easy customization and integration into existing workflows.
Structure:
The repository is structured as follows:

/src: Contains the source code for the Python scripts.
/examples: Provides example input files and scripts for testing and demonstration.
/docs: Comprehensive documentation for users, including a README file.
/tests: Unit tests for code validation.
/LICENSE: The license information for the repository.
Getting Started:
To use the postprocessing scripts:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/qe-postprocessing-python.git
Follow the documentation in the /docs folder to understand the functionalities.
